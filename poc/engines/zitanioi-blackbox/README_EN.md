> **This repository is forked from [FBlackBox/BlackBox](https://github.com/FBlackBox/BlackBox)**, with additional fixes bringing compatibility up to Android 16.

BlackBox is a virtual engine, it can clone and run virtual application on Android,  users don't have to install APK file to run the application on devices. BlackBox control all virtual applications, so you can do anything you want by using BlackBox.

## Support
Currently we don't consider supporting Android 4.x, it supports Android 5.0 ～ 16.0.

Main changes in this fork compared to upstream (Android 16 adaptation):
- Fixed virtual app launch failure (`HCallbackProxy` NPE, and the launch loop caused by the `LaunchActivityItem` swap no longer working on Android 16)
- Fixed WebView `net::ERR_CACHE_MISS` inside the container (`checkSelfPermission(INTERNET)` was wrongly DENIED, causing WebView to block all network; see the `checkPermissionForDevice` and other permission-query hooks)
- Added hot-fix: configure a patch dex per app via long-press; it is injected into the class loader before the app starts (see "Hot-Fix" below)

If conditions permit, downgrade targetSdkVersion to 28 or below for better compatibility.

***Stability has not been tested extensively and is for learning and communication purposes only Please do not use for other purposes***

## Release
Stable version and Canary build version
- Stable version: Stable version is verified and released by administrators. [Download](https://github.com/FBlackBox/BlackBox/releases)
- Canary build version: Canary build version is compiled automatically by Github Actions, it has the newest features, but it may have some bugs which we have not found. [Download](https://github.com/AutoBlackBox/BlackBox/tags)

## Special Instruction

This project distinguishes between 32-bit and 64-bit, it was compiled to 2 different demos. If you can not find your target in application list, please use another architecture.

## Usage
### Step 1.Add initialized code in the Application

```java
    @Override
    protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
        super.attachBaseContext(base);
        try {
            BlackBoxCore.get().doAttachBaseContext(base, new ClientConfiguration() {
                @Override
                public String getHostPackageName() {
                    return base.getPackageName();
                }
            });
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        BlackBoxCore.get().doCreate();
    }
```

### Step 2.Install application
```java
    // Use package name to install provided that application has been install on device
    BlackBoxCore.get().installPackageAsUser("com.tencent.mm", userId);
    
    // Use APK path to install provided that application has not been install on device
    BlackBoxCore.get().installPackageAsUser(new File("/sdcard/com.tencent.mm.apk"), userId);
```

### Step 3.Launch application
```java
   BlackBoxCore.get().launchApk("com.tencent.mm", userId);
```

### App Cloner

### API
#### Get application list that were installed in BlackBox
```java
   // flags can refer to the Android develop documentation
   BlackBoxCore.get().getInstalledApplications(flags, userId);
   
   BlackBoxCore.get().getInstalledPackages(flags, userId);
```

#### Get user information in BlackBox
```java
   List<BUserInfo> users = BlackBoxCore.get().getUsers();
```
If you want to perform more operations, please refer to the source code.


#### Xposed Support
- BlackBox has supported Xposed Modules.
- BlackBox has hidden Xposed Framework, [Xposed Checker](https://www.coolapk.com/apk/190247) and [XposedDetector](https://github.com/vvb2060/XposedDetector) can't detect it.

## Hot-Fix
This fork adds a simple class-replacement hot-fix, without any modification of the target app.

### Usage
1. Long-press the target app on the home page and choose "Hot-Fix Config".
2. Tap "Choose Patch" and pick a patch file (`.dex` / `.apk` / `.jar`) from the file picker.
3. "Stop Running" the app and relaunch it to apply. The dialog shows the current patch status; tap "Remove Patch" to clear it.

### How it works
Class loaders of virtual apps are created and managed by the container. Before the Application is created at process startup, the container loads the patch dex with a temporary DexClassLoader and inserts its `DexPathList.Element` at the head of the app class loader's `dexElements`. Later `loadClass` calls hit the patched classes first, which replaces the original ones. Classes loaded from the patch are defined by the app class loader itself, so their dependencies still resolve against the original dex.

### Limitations & notes
- Only Java/Kotlin classes (dex level) are replaced; resources, native libs and the Manifest are not supported.
- A patch class overrides the original one simply by having the same fully-qualified name; new classes can also be added via the patch.
- After the patch file is updated or removed, the app must be stopped and relaunched to take effect; the patch is injected on every virtual process start (including child processes of multi-process apps).
- Patches are removed automatically when the app is uninstalled, and are stored under the host's private directory `blackbox/hotfix/`.
- Available since 2.2.0.


## How to contribute to this project 
### This project is divided into two modules
- app module, it is used to achieve UI and deal with user action.
- Bcore module, this module is the core of BlackBox, it is used to achieve all functionalities.

You can contribute to this project by making pull requests.
### About pull requests
1. Both Chinese and English commit message / comment are ok,  but you should elaborate on your code.
2. Please follow the code style and design pattern of this project.
3. Welcome everybody take part in this project.

## Plan
 - More Service API virtualization.
 - Provide more interfaces for developers (virtual location,  process injection, etc).

## Sponsorship
If you want to sponsor it, please contact the original author, the FBlackBox team.
